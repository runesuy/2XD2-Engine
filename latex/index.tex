2XD2-\/\+Engine is a 2D game engine built with C++ and SFML. The main objectsives of this project are to provide an easy-\/to-\/use framework for developing 2D games and to offer a modular architecture that allows developers to extend and customize the engine according to their needs.

{\bfseries{This project is still in its early stages of development, all contributions are welcome!}}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Features}{Features}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries{Node-\/based architecture}}\+: The engine is built around a node system, allowing for easy management of game objects and their relationships.
\item {\bfseries{Scene management}}\+: Easily create and switch between different scenes in your game.
\item {\bfseries{Event handling}}\+: Built-\/in event system for handling user input and other events using SFML.
\item {\bfseries{Rendering}}\+: Simple rendering system using SFML for drawing sprites, shapes, and text.
\item {\bfseries{Resource management}}\+: Load and manage game assets such as textures, fonts, and sounds, animations. (WIP)
\item {\bfseries{Collision handling}}\+: Powerfull and efficient collision system. (BASICS)
\item {\bfseries{Physics simulation}}\+: Modular and easily extendable physics base. (COMING SOON)
\end{DoxyItemize}

I plan to add more features in the future, such as physics integration, audio support, and further optimizations and modularity improvements.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Getting Started}{Getting Started}}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
